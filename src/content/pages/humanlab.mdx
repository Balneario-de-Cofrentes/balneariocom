Come do research with us, access thousands of patients during inmersive-intensive stays to control every aspect of your clinical trial

### Our approach to Longevity science

Since 2019, we collaborate with biotech companies, startups, and public institutions in research projects.

The base of our research in Longevity is seeking new protocols that accelerate the improvement of hallmarks of aging or key biomarkers during immersive intensive stays like those we provide at our clinic.

This allows our clinic to push the edge of the state of the art of longevity protocols, testing new treatments, hallmarks and combinations to measure effective improvements based on data.

##### If you are a Startup, Biotech company, Pharma, University and have a research project, wearable or tech you want to test with our patients during long-stays, reach out to partners@balneario.com

Digital Biobank

Supported by CDTI Misiones 2024, we built a digital biobank to create digital twins with multi-year longitudinal data including molecular data, functional data, microbiome, genetics, epigenetics, etc. which we are increasingly expanding in patients and data types

More than 15,000 patients per year enabling any selection criteria and data for your project

Our scale allows us to find the patients that fit with your requirements and who want to participate during long stays and multiple years

Full technical team

We have a team of software engineers, doctors, physiotherapists, biologists, nutritionists, psychologists who can help you plan, organize, develop, take and analyze data

### Clinical Data as a Service

##### With the recent development of our Digital Biobank, we are now in an ideal position to take on more research projects

- Compliant data collection

- Data collection measured by specialized physiotherapists, doctors and engineers

- Control groups

- Virtually any data you want to generate, together with the patient protocolos you need (nutrition guidelines, sleep protocolos, exercise) during long stays

- Selection criteria with anonymized access to data of thousands of patients who come every year

- Support with Ethics Committee approval

- Your devices or technology can be installed in some of our smart rooms or rest of our facilities as needed

### Science4Equity

##### If you are a startup in Pre-seed to Series-A funding:

We understand it can be a challenge to raise a round of VC funding only to spend it on data collection and clinical trials. 

We would love to learn about your project in case we can help you with your clinical trial as a data collection, curation or analysis partner with our 15,000 patients per year.

We innovate with a Science4Equity approach whereby we participate of your round in the form of equity in exchange for supporting your data acquisition of your clinical trial, reducing the impact on your hard-raised cash. This will help you find early results, use the cash for your tech, and optimize for your next round.
 
In occasion we might be able to top it up with a minority investment from our family office. We understand startup risk and are easy going.

### Longevity Ecosystem

##### We are an active member of the longevity ecosystem.

In the last few years we have been hosts to the LBF4, LBF7, Longevity State Conference, Hidromed, and others.

We also often travel internationally to meet other entrepreneurs, clinics, research facilities and to speak at conferences.

 If you want to organize a longevity-related event at our clinic, or want to have our founders speak at your conference, get in touch with us, we love to make new friends along the way
